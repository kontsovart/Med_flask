For getting started server - run app.py

For making some changes in data base - run "python3 manage.py db migrate"

For confirm changes in data base - run "python3 manage.py db upgrade"

For working with data base we use SQLAlchemy. It's a nice tool for connection and make some changes in DB via Flask.
